## Making Job 1 in Jenkins
1. Follow the previous steps for creation from **1 - 4.**
2. Enable Github Project.
3. Enter the **HTTPS link** for the **repository** you wish to link.

### --> Source Code Management
1. select **Git** and enter your **SSH** repository link.

![alt text](/images/job-1-scm.png)

2. Add your credentials.
   1. For the **Kind** section, select **SSH Username with private key**.

![alt text](/images/job-1-privatekey.png)
  
3. Click **Add**.
4. Now, under the **credentials**, you can select the key you've added.

 
1. Below that, under **Branches to build**, change it to `*/main`. Later, this'll be `dev`.

![alt text](/images/job-1-change-branch.png)
 
### --> Build Environment
1. Enable **Provide node and npm bin/ folder to PATH** and specify **NodeJS version 20**. We do this so we can run nodejs and npm commands.
 
![alt text](/images/job-1-node-op.png)
 
### --> Build Steps
1. Add an **execute shell** build step, and insert the following commands:
 
```
cd app
npm install
npm test
```
 
![alt text](/images/job-1-script.png)
 
1. Click save and you'll return to the job screen.
 
### --> On the job screen...
1. Select **Build now** and await your evil machine's birth!!! You might have to do some waiting.
2. You can view the job by clicking the link to it under **build history**.
3. Click **Console Output** and you'll see it working in real time if it hasn't finished yet.



# Jenkins Job 2 Setup: CI to Merge Dev Branch into Main

## Goal
The goal of **Job 2** is to automatically merge the `dev` branch into the `main` branch after tests are successfully completed in **Job 1**.

---

## Steps to Create Job 2

### Step 1: Create a New Job
1. **Log in to Jenkins**.
2. Click **New Item** from the Jenkins dashboard.
3. Enter the job name: `<yourname>-job2-ci-merge`.
4. Choose **Freestyle Project** and click **OK**.



---

### Step 2.1: Configure Source Code Management (Git)
1. Under **Source Code Management**, select **Git**.
2. In the **Repository URL**, enter the SSH URL for your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git@github.com:<your-repo-owner>/sparta-test-app-cicd.git
   ```
3. Under **Credentials**, select your GitHub SSH credentials (`raiyan-jenkins-2-github-app` or the one you have configured).
<br>

4. Under **Branch Specifier**, enter `*/dev`. This specifies the `dev` branch as the one Jenkins will be pulling from.

### Step 2.2 Guide to Setting up a GitHub Webhook for Job 2

####  Configure GitHub Webhook

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**:
   - Navigate to the repository you want to link to Jenkins.

2. **Open the repository settings**:
   - Click on the **Settings** tab of the repository.

3. **Add a new webhook**:
   - In the left-hand menu, click on **Webhooks**.
   - Click the **Add webhook** button.

4. **Enter the webhook URL**:
   - In the **Payload URL** field, enter your Jenkins URL followed by `/github-webhook/`.
     - Example: `http://<jenkins-server-ip>:8080/github-webhook/`
   - Set the **Content type** to `application/json`.

5. **Choose which events trigger the webhook**:
   - Select **Just the push event** to trigger Jenkins builds only when new commits are pushed to the repository.
   - Alternatively, you can select **Let me select individual events** and choose `push` or other relevant events.

6. **Add the webhook**:
   - Click the **Add webhook** button to save the webhook settings.
   - GitHub will now send push notifications to Jenkins when changes are pushed to the repository.


#### Configure Jenkins Job to Trigger from Webhook

1. **Open Job 2 in Jenkins**:
   - Go to your Jenkins dashboard and click on **Job 2** (e.g., `<yourname>-job2-ci-merge`).

2. **Configure the Job**:
   - Click on **Configure**.

3. **Enable the GitHub hook trigger**:
   - Scroll down to the **Build Triggers** section.
   - Check the box for **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling**.
   - This will allow Jenkins to listen for webhook events sent from GitHub and trigger a build.

4. **Save the Job**:
   - Scroll down and click **Save** to store the configuration.

![alt text](/images/job-2-webhook.png)

#### Test the Webhook

1. **Make a Change on the Dev Branch**:
   - Push a change to the `dev` branch of your GitHub repository.

2. **Monitor Jenkins**:
   - After the push, check the Jenkins dashboard to see if **Job 2** was triggered automatically.
   - You can also check the **GitHub Webhook** delivery status:
     - Go back to **GitHub Settings** â†’ **Webhooks** and check the recent deliveries. If successful, it should show the webhook was successfully sent to Jenkins.


---

### Step 3: Configure Build Triggers
1. Scroll down to **Build Triggers**.
2. Check **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling**. This will enable the webhook to trigger this job when changes are pushed to the `dev` branch.

![alt text](/images/job-2-build-project-1-alt.png)
---

### Step 4: Add Build Steps to Merge Branches
1. Scroll down to **Build Steps**.
2. Add a **Execute Shell** build step to merge the `dev` branch into the `main` branch.

   **Shell Command**:
   ```bash
   # Checkout the main branch
   git checkout main

   # Pull the latest changes from main
   git pull origin main

   # Merge the dev branch into the main branch
   git merge origin/dev

   # Push the updated main branch back to GitHub
   git push origin main
   ```

---

### Step 5: Set Up Post-Build Actions to Trigger Job 2 from Job 1
1. Open **Job 1** by navigating to the dashboard and clicking on **Job 1**.
2. Go to **Configure**.
3. Scroll down to **Post-build Actions** and choose **Trigger parameterized build on other projects**.
4. Under **Projects to build**, enter `<yourname>-job2-ci-merge`.
5. Set the **Trigger only if build succeeds** option to ensure Job 2 runs only if Job 1 is successful.

![alt text](/images/job-2-build-project-1-alt.png)
---

### Step 6: Save the Job and Test
1. Click **Save** to complete the setup of Job 2.
2. Trigger **Job 1** manually or by pushing a change to the `dev` branch.
3. Once **Job 1** completes successfully, it will trigger **Job 2**, which will merge the `dev` branch into `main`.

---

### Troubleshooting Tips
- If you encounter issues with the merge command, make sure that Jenkins has the correct SSH credentials to push to your GitHub repository.
- Check the **Console Output** of the jobs to troubleshoot any errors related to Git or credential permissions.
