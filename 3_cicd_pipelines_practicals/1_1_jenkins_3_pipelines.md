# Jenkins Job 2 Setup: CI to Merge Dev Branch into Main

## Goal
The goal of **Job 2** is to automatically merge the `dev` branch into the `main` branch after tests are successfully completed in **Job 1**.

---

## Steps to Create Job 2

### Step 1: Create a New Job
1. **Log in to Jenkins**.
2. Click **New Item** from the Jenkins dashboard.
3. Enter the job name: `<yourname>-job2-ci-merge`.
4. Choose **Freestyle Project** and click **OK**.



---

### Step 2.1: Configure Source Code Management (Git)
1. Under **Source Code Management**, select **Git**.
2. In the **Repository URL**, enter the SSH URL for your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git@github.com:<your-repo-owner>/sparta-test-app-cicd.git
   ```
3. Under **Credentials**, select your GitHub SSH credentials (`raiyan-jenkins-2-github-app` or the one you have configured).
<br>

![alt text](/images/job-1-scm.png)
4. Under **Branch Specifier**, enter `*/dev`. This specifies the `dev` branch as the one Jenkins will be pulling from.
![alt text](/images/job-2-dev-branch.png)

### Step 2.2 Guide to Setting up a GitHub Webhook for Job 2

####  Configure GitHub Webhook

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**:
   - Navigate to the repository you want to link to Jenkins.

2. **Open the repository settings**:
   - Click on the **Settings** tab of the repository.

3. **Add a new webhook**:
   - In the left-hand menu, click on **Webhooks**.
   - Click the **Add webhook** button.

4. **Enter the webhook URL**:
   - In the **Payload URL** field, enter your Jenkins URL followed by `/github-webhook/`.
     - Example: `http://<jenkins-server-ip>:8080/github-webhook/`
   - Set the **Content type** to `application/json`.

5. **Choose which events trigger the webhook**:
   - Select **Just the push event** to trigger Jenkins builds only when new commits are pushed to the repository.
   - Alternatively, you can select **Let me select individual events** and choose `push` or other relevant events.

6. **Add the webhook**:
   - Click the **Add webhook** button to save the webhook settings.
   - GitHub will now send push notifications to Jenkins when changes are pushed to the repository.


#### Configure Jenkins Job to Trigger from Webhook

1. **Open Job 2 in Jenkins**:
   - Go to your Jenkins dashboard and click on **Job 2** (e.g., `<yourname>-job2-ci-merge`).

2. **Configure the Job**:
   - Click on **Configure**.

3. **Enable the GitHub hook trigger**:
   - Scroll down to the **Build Triggers** section.
   - Check the box for **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling**.
   - This will allow Jenkins to listen for webhook events sent from GitHub and trigger a build.

4. **Save the Job**:
   - Scroll down and click **Save** to store the configuration.

![alt text](/images/job-2-webhook.png)

#### Test the Webhook

1. **Make a Change on the Dev Branch**:
   - Push a change to the `dev` branch of your GitHub repository.

2. **Monitor Jenkins**:
   - After the push, check the Jenkins dashboard to see if **Job 2** was triggered automatically.
   - You can also check the **GitHub Webhook** delivery status:
     - Go back to **GitHub Settings** â†’ **Webhooks** and check the recent deliveries. If successful, it should show the webhook was successfully sent to Jenkins.


---

### Step 3: Configure Build Triggers
1. Scroll down to **Build Triggers**.
2. Check **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling**. This will enable the webhook to trigger this job when changes are pushed to the `dev` branch.
  <br>
![alt text](/images/job-2-build-project-1-alt.png)
---

### Step 4: Add Build Steps to Merge Branches
1. Scroll down to **Build Steps**.
2. Add a **Execute Shell** build step to merge the `dev` branch into the `main` branch.

   **Shell Command**:
   ```bash
   # Checkout the main branch
   git checkout main

   # Pull the latest changes from main
   git pull origin main

   # Merge the dev branch into the main branch
   git merge origin/dev

   # Push the updated main branch back to GitHub
   git push origin main
   ```
3. Alternatively a Better way is to not open execute shell and use git publishing plugin in post actions section.
  <br>
![alt text](/images/job-2-gitpublisher.png)
---

### Step 5: Set Up Post-Build Actions to Trigger Job 2 from Job 1
1. Open **Job 1** by navigating to the dashboard and clicking on **Job 1**.
2. Go to **Configure**.
3. Scroll down to **Post-build Actions** and choose **Trigger parameterized build on other projects**.
4. Under **Projects to build**, enter `<yourname>-job2-ci-merge`.
5. Set the **Trigger only if build succeeds** option to ensure Job 2 runs only if Job 1 is successful.
  <br>
![alt text](/images/job-2-build-project-1-alt.png)
---

### Step 6: Save the Job and Test
1. Click **Save** to complete the setup of Job 2.
2. Trigger **Job 1** manually or by pushing a change to the `dev` branch.
3. Once **Job 1** completes successfully, it will trigger **Job 2**, which will merge the `dev` branch into `main`.

---

### Troubleshooting Tips
- If you encounter issues with the merge command, make sure that Jenkins has the correct SSH credentials to push to your GitHub repository.
- Check the **Console Output** of the jobs to troubleshoot any errors related to Git or credential permissions.

# Job 3: Continuous Deployment to EC2 Using SSH Agent and rsync

This job will deploy the application from Jenkins to an AWS EC2 instance by using the `ssh-agent` to manage SSH keys and `rsync` for efficient file transfer.

## Steps to Create Job 3

### 0. Create an EC2 instance for only a Node App 
  <br>
- More Info on with steps on [How to create EC2 instance](/2_aws_practical/0_two_tier_deploy_with_1_subnet.md)
- Take note of where you save **private key** and **http/ssh** connections are **allowed**

### 1. Set Up Jenkins Job

- **Job Name**: `<yourname>-job3-cd-deploy`
- Go to Jenkins Dashboard, click **New Item**.
- Choose **Freestyle project** (or Pipeline, if preferred) and name it `<yourname>-job3-cd-deploy`.
- Click **OK** to create the job.

### 2.1  Configure SSH Agent 

- Ensure the **SSH Agent Plugin** is installed 
  
- Go to **Manage Jenkins** â†’ **Manage Credentials** â†’ **Global**.
  - Add a new credential of type **SSH Username with private key**.
  - Paste the private SSH key for your EC2 instance and give the credential an ID (e.g., `aws-ssh-key`).
  <br>
  ![alt text](/images/job-3-5-add-credential-store.png)

### 2.2 How to Get Private Key

Following steps to find your ec2 SSH key pair on your local machine:

1. **Open Terminal** (or Command Prompt on Windows if using Git Bash).
   
2. **Find SSH Key**: when EC2 instance was created you received a private key to the vm only, while public key remained instead ec2 vm.
3. **Print and paste key** into jenkins cred store. Using cat command and store into jenkins
<br>

   ![alt text](/images/job-3-6-private-key.png)
   ![alt text](/images/job-3-6-add-credential-store.png)
  <br>

### 3. Configure SSH Agent in the Job

- In the job configuration, scroll to the **Build Environment** section.
- Check the option **"SSH Agent"**.
- Select the **SSH private key credential** you created (e.g., `raiyan-aws-key`).
![alt text](/images/job-3-1-ssh-agent-cred.png)

### 4. Add Build Step: Execute Shell

- Scroll down to the **Build** section and click **Add build step** â†’ **Execute shell**.
- Paste the following shell script:
- [Pipeline script](/script_reference/1_1_job_3_run_pipeline_script.sh)
```bash
# Define variables
EC2_USER=ubuntu
EC2_IP=34.241.57.116
REMOTE_PATH=/home/ubuntu/app3

# Add the EC2 instance to known hosts (this prevents SSH prompt when connecting for the first time)
ssh-keyscan -H $EC2_IP >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

# Copy files from Jenkins workspace to the remote EC2 instance using rsync
rsync -avz -e "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" $(pwd)/ $EC2_USER@$EC2_IP:$REMOTE_PATH

# SSH into EC2 instance and execute deployment commands
ssh $EC2_USER@$EC2_IP << EOF
    pm2 kill
    # Navigate to the app directory
    cd $REMOTE_PATH/app
    # Run npm install and start the app with pm2
    npm install
    pm2 start app.js
EOF
```

### Script Explanation

1. **Define Variables**:
    - `EC2_USER=ubuntu`: Your EC2 instance's SSH username (commonly `ubuntu`).
    - `EC2_IP=34.241.57.116`: The public IP address of your EC2 instance.
    - `REMOTE_PATH=/home/ubuntu/app3`: The directory path on the EC2 instance where files will be deployed.

2. **Add EC2 to Known Hosts**:
    - `ssh-keyscan -H $EC2_IP >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts`: Adds the EC2 instanceâ€™s SSH key to known hosts to avoid prompts.

3. **File Transfer Using rsync**:
    - `rsync -avz -e "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" $(pwd)/ $EC2_USER@$EC2_IP:$REMOTE_PATH`: Copies files from Jenkins workspace to EC2 instance efficiently.

4. **Remote Commands**:
    - SSH into the EC2 instance and execute the following:
      - `pm2 kill`: Stops all running PM2 processes.
      - `cd $REMOTE_PATH/app`: Navigate to the app directory.
      - `npm install`: Installs dependencies from the `package.json` file.
      - `pm2 start app.js`: Starts the app with PM2.

### 5. Save and Run the Job

- After pasting the script, click **Save**.
- Trigger the job manually by clicking **Build Now**, or set up automatic triggers (e.g., after a successful build in CI).

### 6. Verify Deployment

- Once the job runs, Jenkins will:
  - Authenticate to the EC2 instance using `ssh-agent`.
  - Copy the project files to the EC2 instance using `rsync`.
  - SSH into the instance and install dependencies, then start the app with PM2.
  
## Summary:
You successfully set up a Jenkins job to deploy an application to an AWS EC2 instance using SSH agent for secure key management and rsync for efficient file transfer.

## Create Job 3 alternative:

steps and script changes required when using Jenkins **"Use secret text(s) or file(s)"** instead of using ssh-agent plugin and also show how to use `scp` command instead of `rsync` without EOF input 

## Steps:

### 1. Add Secret Text or File to Jenkins:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** â†’ **Manage Credentials** â†’ **Global**.
   - Add a new credential of type **"Secret text"** or **"Secret file"**:
     - **Secret Text**: Paste the contents of your private key as text.
     - **Secret File**: Upload the private key as a file.
   - Give the credential a meaningful ID (e.g., `aws-ssh-key-secret`).

### 2. Configure Job to Use Secret:
   - In your Jenkins job configuration, scroll to the **Build Environment** section.
   - Check **"Use secret text(s) or file(s)"**.
   - Under **Bindings**, click **Add** â†’ **"Secret text"** or **"Secret file"**.
   - Select the credential ID (e.g., `aws-ssh-key-secret`).
   - Bind the secret to an environment variable (e.g., `AWS_SSH_KEY`).

### 3. Add Build Step: Execute Shell

- Scroll down to the **Build** section and click **Add build step** â†’ **Execute shell**.
- Paste the following shell script:
- [Pipeline script](/script_reference/1_1_job_3_first_version_script.sh)
```bash
# Define variables
EC2_USER=ubuntu
EC2_IP=34.241.57.116
REMOTE_PATH=/home/ubuntu/app3

# Add the EC2 instance to known hosts (this prevents SSH prompt when connecting for the first time)
ssh-keyscan -H $EC2_IP >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
echo $AWS_SSH_KEY

ssh -i  $AWS_SSH_KEY $EC2_USER@$EC2_IP "rm -rf $REMOTE_PATH && pm2 kill"
# Use scp to copy code from Jenkins workspace to EC2
scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i $AWS_SSH_KEY -r $(pwd) $EC2_USER@$EC2_IP:$REMOTE_PATH

ssh -i  $AWS_SSH_KEY $EC2_USER@$EC2_IP "cd $REMOTE_PATH/app && npm install && pm2 start app.js"

```
