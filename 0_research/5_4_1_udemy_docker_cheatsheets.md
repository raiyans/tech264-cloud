# Creating the Elastic Beanstalk Environment

Please use the following instructions to create an environment with the Amazon Linux 2023 Platform. Since the AWS UI and options change frequently, these are provided as a lecture note instead of a video lecture.

1. Go to AWS Management Console.
2. Search for Elastic Beanstalk and click the Elastic Beanstalk service.
3. Click the **Create environment** button.
4. Provide an **Application name**, which will auto-populate an **Environment name**.
5. Scroll down to find the **Platform** section. Select the Platform of **Docker**. This will auto-select several default options.
6. Scroll down to the **Presets** section and make sure that **free tier eligible** has been selected.
7. Click the **Next** button to move to Step #2.
8. You will be taken to a **Service Access** configuration form. Ensure that **Use an existing service role** is selected and that the service role created in Section 7 is listed. This should also auto-populate the EC2 instance profile with the ec2-role that was previously created.
9. Click the **Skip to Review** button.
10. Click the **Submit** button and wait for your new Elastic Beanstalk application and environment to be created and launched.

**Important**: Attached to this lecture is a cheatsheet complete with all the steps to configure the multi-container project in AWS.

## Required Updates for Docker Compose

1. **Rename the current docker-compose file**  
   Rename the `docker-compose.yml` file to `docker-compose-dev.yml`. Going forward you will need to pass a flag to specify which compose file you want to build and run from:
   ```sh
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up --build
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml down



# AWS Configuration Cheat Sheet - Updated for new UI

This lecture note is not intended to be a replacement for the videos, but to serve as a cheat sheet for students who want to quickly run through the AWS configuration steps or easily see if they missed a step. It will also help navigate through the changes to the AWS UI since the course was recorded.

## Deploying App

1. Make a small change to your `src/App.js` file in the greeting text.
2. In the project root, in your terminal run:
```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "testing deployment"
   git push origin main
```
3. Go to your Travis Dashboard and check the status of your build.
   - The status should eventually return with a green checkmark and show "build passing".

4. Go to your AWS Elastic Beanstalk application.
   - It should say "Elastic Beanstalk is updating your environment".
   - It should eventually show a green checkmark under "Health". You will now be able to access your application at the external URL provided under the environment name.
