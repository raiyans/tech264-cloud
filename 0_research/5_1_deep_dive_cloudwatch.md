## What is AWS Cloudwatch?
* AWS CloudWatch is like a super helpful **tool** that keeps an eye on your stuff (**monitors**) in the **cloud**. 
* Imagine you have a bunch of computers, databases, and other resources **running on Amazon Web Services** (AWS). 
* CloudWatch helps you monitor all of these things to make sure they are working properly.

### Key Features
* **Monitoring**: It tracks important data (called metrics) like how much CPU your servers are using, how much memory is left, and how much traffic your website is getting.
* **Alarms**: You can set up alarms to get notified if something goes wrong. For example, if your server's CPU usage gets too high, CloudWatch can send you an alert.
* **Logs**: It collects and stores log files from your applications and services. This helps you troubleshoot issues by looking at what happened at specific times.
* **Dashboards**: You can create visual dashboards to see all your metrics and alarms in one place. This makes it easy to understand the health of your system at a glance.

> AWS CloudWatch is like a security guard and a health monitor for your cloud resources, making sure everything runs smoothly and alerting you if something needs attention.

# AWS CloudWatch Dashboards
A guide on how to create and configure AWS CloudWatch dashboards to effectively monitor and visualise your cloud infrastructure.

## How to Create and Configure AWS CloudWatch Dashboards
### Step 1: Access CloudWatch Dashboards
1. Log in to **AWS Management Console**: Navigate to the **AWS CloudWatch service**.
2. Click on the "Dashboards" link in the **CloudWatch admin control panel**.

### Step 2: Create a New Dashboard
* Click on the "Create Dashboard" button.
* A pop-up window will appear. Enter a **name** for your new dashboard (e.g., "AWS Demo") and click "Create Dashboard".

### Step 3: Add Visualisations
1. Select Visualisation Type: Choose the type of visualisation you want to add to your dashboard. Options include:
   * **Line Visualisation**: Compare metrics over time.
   * **Stacked Area**: Compare total value over time.
   * **Number**: Instantly see the latest value of the metric.
   * **Text**: Add free text with markdown formatting.
2. Click on "Configure" after selecting your desired visualisation type.

### Step 4: Choose Metrics
1. Choose the **metric** you want to plot for the visualisation. 
   * For example, to plot CPU utilisation for an EC2 instance:
     * Click on "EC2" and then "All Metrics".
     * Type "CPU Utilisation" in the search box.
     * Select the desired metric from the filtered list.

### Step 5: Adjust Time Dimensions
1. Set Time Frame: Choose the appropriate **time frame** for your visualisation (e.g., 1 hour, 3 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 1 week).
2. View Data: The data for the selected metric will be **plotted on the dashboard**. Adjust the time frame to see different periods of data.

### Step 6: Add Multiple Metrics
1. You can add additional metrics **from other resources** (e.g., S3 buckets, databases, web servers) to the **same dashboard**.
   * This helps visualise and correlate various scenarios and understand how different resources behave in relation to each other.

### Step 7: Customise the Dashboard
1. **Modify Metrics**: Use the graph metric tab to view and modify the metrics being plotted.
2. **Change Statistics**: Switch between average, maximum, or other statistical values based on your requirements.
3. **Adjust Periods**: Change the period (e.g., 30 days, 7 days, 1 day, 1 hour) to suit your needs.
4. **Axis Options**: Rotate and modify the y-axis limits as needed.

### Step 8: Change Visualisation Types
1. **Switch Visualisation Types**: Change the visualisation type (e.g., from line to stacked area or number) to suit your preferences.
2. **Set Refresh Intervals**: Determine how often the visualisation **updates with fresh data** (e.g., every 15 minutes, 5 minutes, 1 minute).

### Step 9: Finalise the Dashboard
1. Click on "Create Widget" to **finalise the dashboard** with the new visualisation.
2. Manage Dashboards: View, pin, and add new visualisations to existing dashboards as needed.

# AWS CloudWatch Alarms
Overview:
* Set up alarms based on CloudWatch metrics.
* Trigger specific jobs or notify users when alarm conditions are met.

## Alarm States
### Alarm State
* **Threshold** specified in the alarm definition has been **reached** or **crossed**.
* Alarm transitions to the alarm state.

### Insufficient Data State
* **Alarm** does **not have sufficient data** for its metrics.
* Monitor transitions to insufficient data state if data is missing or incomplete.

### OK State
* **Metric** is **within the specified** acceptable **range**.
* Monitor is in the OK state.

## Creating an Alarm
1. Go to the **CloudWatch dashboard** and click on the "alarms" link.
2. Click on "Create Alarm".
3. Select Metrics:
   * Choose the **service** (e.g., EC2) and search for the **desired metric** (e.g., CPU utilisation).
   * Select the **metric** and choose the **statistic** (e.g., maximum) and **interval** (e.g., one minute).

4. Define Alarm
   * **Name** the alarm (e.g., EC2 CPU utilisation alarm).
   * Set the **description** (e.g., test alarm).
   * Specify the **threshold** (e.g., CPU utilisation â‰¥ 60% for one consecutive period of 15 minutes).
   * Adjust the threshold and consecutive periods as needed.

5. Set Actions
* Define the **state** that **triggers the notification** (e.g., alarm state).
* Choose the **notification topic** (e.g., email address of the subscriber).
* Add other actions if needed (e.g., auto-scaling, EC2 actions).

6. Click on "Create Alarm".

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting
* **Insufficient Data State**: Identify and troubleshoot issues to ensure CloudWatch can reliably monitor the metrics.
* **OK State**: Ensure the metric is within the acceptable range.

### Example Scenario
CPU Utilisation Alarm:
* Create an alarm for **CPU utilisation** of an EC2 instance.
* **Set the threshold** to 1% for one consecutive period.
* **Configure the alarm** to trigger notifications when the CPU utilisation exceeds the threshold.
