# The Monolith vs 2 - Tier Architecture
 
## The Monolith
A monolithic architecture is an all-in-one approach where all components of an application—such as user interface, business logic, and data access—are part of a single, tightly-coupled codebase or deployment.
 
Characteristics:
 
- **Single Codebase**: Built and deployed as one unit.
- **Tightly Coupled**: Components depend on one another.
- **Simple Development**: Easier to develop and deploy initially.
- **Single Deployment**: Updates require redeploying the entire application.
 
Advantages:
 
- **Easier Development**: Small teams can build the entire system.
- **Simple Deployment**: Straightforward as it’s one unit.
- **Performance**: Faster internal communication.
 
Disadvantages:
 
- **Scalability**: Difficult to scale; must scale the whole app.
- **Maintenance**: Harder to maintain as complexity grows.
- **Flexibility**: Hard to introduce new technologies.
- **Risk of Failure**: A failure can impact the entire system.
 
## 2 Tier Architecture
In a 2-tier architecture, the application is divided into two layers: the client-side (frontend) and the server-side (backend). The server typically manages business logic and database interactions.
 
Characteristics:
 
**Client-Server Model**: Frontend and backend are separate.
**Direct Database Access**: Client communicates directly with the database.
**Decoupling**: UI and backend run independently.
 
Advantages:
 
**Separation of Concerns**: Easier to update frontend or backend.
**Better Scalability**: Scale backend independently.
**Maintainability**: Issues can be resolved without disrupting the client.
 
Disadvantages:
 
**Network Dependency**: Performance relies on network speed.
**Latency**: Increased communication latency compared to a monolith.
**Complexity**: More complex due to separate client and server components.
