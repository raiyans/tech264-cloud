DevOps Project 6 Brief - 2-Tier Deployment of ‘Library’ Java Spring Boot App

Overview:

This goal of this project is to implement the 2-tier deployment of a Java Spring Boot app using various methods, including virtualisation and containerisation.

You should work through these Stages (approximate timings you should aim for are bracketed):

1. Create a private GitHub repository to store the Java app and SQL script to seed the database (check your course’s Teams channel’s file section for it or ask your trainer for the ‘library-java17-mysql-app' zip file of the app code). Use the README.md file included with the app code to understand the app.

2. Deploy the app and database on your local machine (½ day)

3. Deploy the app and database on AWS or Azure using Virtual Machines. Automate it via Bash provision scripts that work in user data. (1 day)

4. Deploy the app and database on AWS or Azure using containers running on a Virtual Machine (Docker Compose). Automate it via Bash provision scripts that work in user data. (1-2 days)

5. Deploy the app and database on AWS or Azure using Kubernetes (Minikube) running on a Virtual Machine. Automate it via Bash provision scripts that work in user data. The Bash scripts could deploy on Kubernetes via applying YAML definition files or (optional) using a Helm chart. (1-2 days)
